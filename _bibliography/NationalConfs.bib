  abstract     = {A recurrent problem encountered in electron microscopy is to achieve a trade-off between a correct signal-to-noise ratio and a non-destructive beam. As the scanning transmission electron microscopy can acquire spatial and spectral datacubes, one of its main advantages is the ability to acquire pixel spectra at only some spatial locations.  As a consequence, partial acquisition schemes are conceivable, provided a reconstruction of the full data cube is conducted as a post-processing step.  This paper proposed a reconstruction approach of EELS spectrum-images which exploits the spectral redundancy and the spatial smoothness of the image.  The performance of proposed scheme is illustrated thanks to experiments conducted on a realistic dataset.},
