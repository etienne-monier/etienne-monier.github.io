     abstract  = {In the most general case, source localization has to take into account the radiation pattern of the sources of interest. This is particularly important when the sensors surround the sources, and the sources are anisotropic, as is the case in several applications (EEG, speech, musical instruments, etc.). Cramer-Rao bounds for the joint estimation of the position of a source and its radiation pattern are computed for simple cases of sensor array geometries and source models, showing that a good match between the source and the model improves the Cramer-Rao bounds. It is also shown that, in general, using a model more complex than the source makes the Fisher information matrix singular. These results are supported by numerical simulations and physical interpretations.},

     abstract     = {Electron microscopy has shown to be a very powerful tool to deeply analyze the chemical composition at various scales. However, many samples can not be analyzed with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio because of the radiation damage induced by the electron beam. Particularly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) which acquires a spectrum for each spatial position requires high beam intensity. Scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) sequentially acquire data cubes by scanning the electron probe over the sample and record a spectrum for each spatial position. Recent works developed new acquisition procedures, which allow for partial acquisition schemes following a predetermined scan pattern. A reconstruction of the full data cube is conducted as a post-processing step. A multi-band image reconstruction procedure which exploits the spectral structure and the spatial smoothness of STEM-EELS images is explained here. The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated thanks to experiments conducted on a realistic phantom dataset as well as real EELS spectrum-image.},
